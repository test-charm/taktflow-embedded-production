## Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Comment Lock

`HITL` means human-reviewer-owned comment content.

**Marker standard (code-friendly):**
- Markdown: `<!-- HITL-LOCK START:<id> -->` ... `<!-- HITL-LOCK END:<id> -->`
- C/C++/Java/JS/TS: `// HITL-LOCK START:<id>` ... `// HITL-LOCK END:<id>`
- Python/Shell/YAML/TOML: `# HITL-LOCK START:<id>` ... `# HITL-LOCK END:<id>`

**Rules:**
- AI must never edit, reformat, move, or delete text inside any `HITL-LOCK` block.
- Append-only: AI may add new comments/changes only; prior HITL comments stay unchanged.
- If a locked comment needs revision, add a new note outside the lock or ask the human reviewer to unlock it.

# ASPICE Folder Map

This folder contains project artifacts organized by Automotive SPICE process areas.

## How To Read This Folder

- `plans` files are execution workstreams (tasks, gates, progress).
- `system`, `software`, and `verification` files are the main technical specifications and evidence.
- If you are new, start with the "Recommended Reading Path" below.

## Process Coverage Snapshot

Assessment date: 2026-07-06. This folder is strong as a draft ASPICE evidence
package, but it is not yet a release assessment package.

| Process Area | Current Evidence | Main Gap Before Release |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| SYS.1 | Stakeholder requirements exist and trace into system requirements. | Refresh traceability after current implementation/doc updates. |
| SYS.2 | System requirements exist and are linked into safety requirements. | Resolve any remaining partial/test-only trace rows in generated matrices. |
| SYS.3 | System architecture, interfaces, CAN topology, and CAN matrix exist. | Keep DBC/CAN matrix as the single communication source of truth and regenerate dependent evidence. |
| SWE.1 | Software requirements exist per ECU/BSW and link to safety requirements. | Refresh stale path-level traces from earlier firmware layout. |
| SWE.2 | Software, BSW, and vECU architecture documents exist. | Confirm architecture-to-test trace for changed SIL/gateway paths. |
| SWE.3 | Implementation evidence exists in firmware and generated trace matrices. | Close generated matrix partial implementation rows or justify exclusions. |
| SWE.4 | Unit plan/report are approved; recorded report shows all tests passing. | Attach current coverage/static-analysis artifacts; close MC/DC evidence. |
| SWE.5 | Integration strategy, plan, and report exist with passing recorded tests. | Tie integration evidence to the current release baseline and SIL scenarios. |
| SWE.6 | Verification plan and release notes exist as stubs. | Add SW qualification specification and report. |
| SYS.4 | System integration report exists as a stub. | Add system integration plan/spec and fill physical/SIL interface results. |
| SYS.5 | System verification report exists as a stub. | Add system verification plan/spec and link safety validation results. |
| SUP.1 | QA plan exists and is now mapped to activities, criteria, and review gates. | Attach actual QA review records with findings and dispositions. |
| SUP.8 | CM folder exists for configuration/change management evidence. | Attach baseline IDs to verification reports and release notes. |
| HWE | Hardware engineering docs exist. | Complete quantitative hardware metrics and COTS tailoring rationale. |

## Assessment Notes

- Treat `docs/aspice/traceability/traceability-matrix.md` as the process-level
  traceability snapshot and `docs/safety/verification/traceability-matrix.md`
  as the safety-focused traceability snapshot.
- Treat xIL evidence by level: SIL supports SWE.4/SWE.5/SWE.6, while physical
  HIL is required for SYS.4/SYS.5 and ISO 26262 safety validation.
- Do not claim release readiness from a passing SIL demo alone; require
  scenario logs, build baselines, CAN traces, timing data, and independent
  review records.

## Plan Vs Spec (Important)

Use these together:

- `docs/aspice/plans/SYS.1-system-requirements/safety-workstream.md` -> links to SYS.1 and safety requirement/spec docs
- `docs/aspice/plans/SYS.2-system-architecture/interfaces-and-bsw-workstream.md` -> links to SYS.2/SYS.3 interface and architecture docs
- `docs/aspice/plans/SWE.1-2-requirements-and-architecture/` -> software requirements and architecture execution tracking

The plan files do not replace the specification files; they point to them and track completion.
